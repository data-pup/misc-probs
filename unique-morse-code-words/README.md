International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is
mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows: "a" maps to ".-", "b" maps
to "-...", "c" maps to "-.-.", and so on.

Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the
Morse code of each letter. For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-.-....-",
(which is the concatenation "-.-." + "-..." + ".-"). We'll call such a
concatenation, the transformation of a word.

Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.
